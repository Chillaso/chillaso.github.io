Hi! Chillaso here. Today we are going to see how to build a RESTful API with Kotlin and Spring Boot. This is a project I did for a Spring course in (atSistemas)[https://www.atsistemas.com] I think could be useful for everybody who want to learn something about this irruptive language and its application out of Android projects.

Since 2017, Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x allow Kotlin support. This might be a problem for legacy services, but I think updating and upgrading must be a constant in our days, so if we obvious this point, I think Java community should adapt Kotlin little by little.
