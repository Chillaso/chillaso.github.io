Hello everybody! I think the best first post I can do is how build this website, step by step. Probably this post will change in the future in order to reflect all changes in web. Hope you enjoy and learn!

First at all, we need to know something called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) there is where magic occurs. Github pages host our pages and use CI/CD to mantain the page updated. We have one page per user and the free domain is like this web, chillaso.github.io.
